            <p>To be short, dude - we need to track your activitity. You know it, we know it, damn - everyone know's it. Even my iguana Pepe. Though, he's much smarter than half of the people i know, maybe that's why. By the way, here's my boy. Isn't he cute? Though, i'm a bit bothered by that tired look filled with wisdom and doom.</p>

            <p>Anywaay... So what of it that we keep an eye on what you're doing? That's how world web works nowadays. If you don't like it just go read some old dusty books. <br>
